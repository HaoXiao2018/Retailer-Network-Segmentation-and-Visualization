## Overview
This is a demonstration of a data analysis and visualization project we worked on between January 2018 and June 2018 for a Chicago-based e-commerce company ShopRunner [[link](https://www.shoprunner.com/home)]. We re-created the raw data by adding a lot of randomness and masked/changed names of a lot of fields.
